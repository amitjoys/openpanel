## Prohibited Uses

Unless you have explicit written permission from Devbaytech or your use falls under the acceptable uses mentioned above, the use of Devbaytech trademarks is strictly prohibited. Here are examples of prohibited uses that may be considered for permission upon request:

- Use of Devbaytech trademarks in connection with a public website offering Devbaytech software for installation and use on a server (instead of directing users to the official Devbaytech site).

In these cases:

- Adherence to the terms of the open-source license for Devbaytech software products and code is mandatory.
- Removal of all Devbaytech logos is required, with the adoption of your own branding to clearly signify no affiliation with or endorsement by Devbaytech.
- Avoidance of using any Devbaytech trademark in connection with the user-facing name, branding, or marketing materials of your project.
- Usage of word marks, but not logos, in truthful statements describing the relationship between your software and Devbaytech is allowed. For instance, "this software is derived from the source code of the Devbaytech software," along with a disclaimer that your project is not officially associated with Devbaytech or its products.

Devbaytech reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to (i) terminate, revoke, modify, or change permission to use the trademarks at any time and; (ii) object to any use or misuse of the trademarks globally. Any changes to these guidelines are effective immediately upon posting, and your continued use of the trademarks following revised guidelines signifies your acceptance of such revisions.
